🌤 Weather App

A simple and responsive Weather App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by a weather API.
It allows users to:

🌎 Search weather by city name

🌡 View real-time temperature, humidity, and wind speed

🎨 Experience a clean and minimal UI

This project was a great way to practice API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch), and responsive web design.
